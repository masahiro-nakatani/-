sdesc: "GNU Internationalization runtime library"
ldesc: "The GNU gettext package provides a set of tools and
documentation for producing
multi-lingual messages in programs. Tools include a set of conventions about
how programs should be written to support message catalogs, a directory and
file naming organization for the message catalogs, a runtime library which
supports the retrieval of translated messages, and stand-alone programs for
handling the translatable and the already translated strings. Gettext provides
an easy to use library and tools for creating, using, and modifying natural
language catalogs and is a powerful and simple method for internationalizing
programs."
